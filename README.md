# CPCipher
A simple encryption/decryption program which implements basic (handwritten, for the time being) encryption methods.

Currently implements:
  - Bacon Cipher
  - Caesarian Shift
  - ROT13
  - Vigenere Square

## Notes
The Bacon cipher implements the first step of the actual cipher, i.e. substitution; it is not true steganography.

The Vigenere cipher cannot currently handle numerals; they must be entered as words.

Comes with a few skins for fanciness.
