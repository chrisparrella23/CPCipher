# CPCipher
A simple encryption/decryption program which implements basic (handwritten, for the time being) encryption methods.

Currently implements:
  - Caesarian Shift
  - Vigenere Square

The Vigenere Cipher cannot currently handle numerals; they must be entered as words.

Comes with a few skins for fanciness.
